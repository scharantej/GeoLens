## Flask Application Design: GeoJSON Visualization with Leaflet

### HTML Files:

1. `index.html`:
   - Serves as the main application page.
   - Contains elements for map initialization, including the Leaflet script and map container.
   - Includes a button to allow users to upload their GeoJSON data.

2. `map.html`:
   - Responsible for displaying the interactive map.
   - Uses Leaflet to render the map, load the points from GeoJSON data, and handle user interactions like panning, zooming, and point selection.
   - Includes a sidebar panel to display information about the selected point.

### Routes:

1. `/`:
   - The root route that renders the `index.html` page.

2. `/upload`:
   - Handles the uploading of GeoJSON data by users.
   - Validates the input and saves the valid GeoJSON data in a suitable location (e.g., a database).
   - Redirects to the `/map` route after successful upload.

3. `/map`:
   - Renders the `map.html` page with the uploaded or default GeoJSON data.
   - Responds to user interactions, such as point selection, and retrieves appropriate information from the database or a suitable data source to display in the sidebar panel.

## Explanation:

This Flask application is designed to fulfill the requirements of creating a user-friendly GeoJSON visualization tool. The HTML files provide a clear and structured layout for the application. The `index.html` acts as the main entry point, where users can upload their GeoJSON data. The `map.html` is responsible for rendering the interactive map, handling user interactions, and displaying detailed information about the selected points.

The routes define the functionality of the application. The root route (`/`) serves the `index.html` page, while the `/upload` route handles the uploading and processing of GeoJSON data. The `/map` route renders the map and responds to user interactions.
